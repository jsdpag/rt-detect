% 
% Creates unsigned 16-bit integer codes for each state named in states, a
% cell array of strings. Discards special values 1, used by ARCADE for init
% and shutdown time stamps, and the session Pause/Resume codes. The latter
% are found in the session's ArcadeConfig object. Reserves the use of value
% 65534 & 65535 (2^16-[2,1] i.e. intmax( 'uint16' )-[2,1]) to signal the
% start and end of a text stream (see below). All state names must be valid
% MATLAB field names. Returns struct e, where each field names an event and
% contains its numeric code i.e. marker.
% 
% Four unique event markers are assigned to each state to time-stamp the
% following events, each time that the state executes (State.run() called).
% For a state with name <state>, these events are called:
%   
%   <state>_entry - Beginning of onEntry function calls, before any other
%     onEntry function executes. This should be considered optional. Use it
%     only if there is any onEntry activity that consumes time.
%   
%   <state>_timing - Timer starts and counts down the state's duration.
%     This should be considered mandatory and must always be the last to
%     execute in the onEntry functions.
%
%   <state>_end - The timer has stopped and the state will transition to
%     the next state in the task. This occurs if the timer runs down. Or
%     when an external event is detected that the state must respond to.
%     This should be considered manditory and must always be the first to
%     execute in the onExit functions.
%   
%   <state>_exit - Finised executing all other onExit function calls.
%     This should be considered optional. Use it only if there is any
%     onExit activity that consumes time other than event marking
%     <state>_end.
% 
% Two more event markers are defined to signal the beginning and end of a
% text stream:
%   
%   TextUTF16_entry - All event markers that follow this should be
%     interpreted as text with UTF-16 encoding. Only values between 0 and
%     65533 are valid. Has value 65534.
%   
%   TextUTF16_exit - Finished text stream. Interpret all following event
%     markers as time-stamped events in the trial. Has value 65535.
